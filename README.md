## About Me

Hi All,  I'm Thomas, a member of `Twinkle AI`, a Traditional Chinese language model research community. I'm a developer focused on democratizing AI via open-source contributions to Hugging Face `Optimum-Quanto` and `marimo`, enhancing developer tools, and sharing knowledge.

As a contributor to Hugging Face `Optimum-Quanto` and an active member of the `marimo` community, I focus on improving the usability of developer tools. I engage with the community through three key pillars:

- **Code Contribution:** Enhancing foundational tools by contributing to key Hugging Face ecosystem projects, such as providing the StableDiffusion example for `Optimum-Quanto`.

- **Knowledge Sharing:** Authoring educational notebooks for `marimo-learn` and participating in the official Traditional Chinese translation of the `Hugging Face Course` to make advanced AI more accessible.

- **Community Internationalization:** Contributing to the official Traditional Chinese translation for `marimo`, enabling the local developer community to seamlessly adopt world-class tools.

My open-source journey can be followed on [github.com/thliang01](https://github.com/thliang01) and [huggingface.co/thliang01](https://huggingface.co/thliang01).
